# ECS 160: Docker Commands

### Run a docker container
Running a docker container sets up a docker image as a usable container on your system. It will be assigned a name and ID. This info
can be accessed via the command: docker ps -a

### Start existing container without interactive mode
docker start id_of_container

This is how you get the id_of_container:
docker ps -a

Gives you list of all your dockers and their IDs, names, CREATED timestamps, etc.
Pick the ID of the container you want.

### List all running docker containers

docker container ls

### Copy a file from host machine to docker container

docker cp maxTweeter.c jolly_curie:other-afl-examples/csv/maxTweeter.c

docker container attach id_of_container (this should put you inside the container)

Go to path of maxTweeter.c

You should see the file there now.
